# Mock Airbnb with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB

## Overview

Welcome to the Mock Airbnb Project! This web application aims to replicate the basic functionalities of Airbnb using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. In addition to the core booking and listing features, the project will implement OAuth authentication to enable users to sign in as well as a third party API to fetch sample listing data.


## Features

1. **Property Listings:** Users can browse through a list of available properties, view details, and see images.
2. **Booking System:** Users can book a property for specific dates, and property owners can manage their bookings.
3. **User Authentication:** OAuth authentication will be implemented, allowing users to sign in.
4. **Search and Filters:** Implement a robust search and filtering system to help users find the perfect property.

## Challenges

1. **OAuth Integration:** Implementing OAuth for user authentication can be challenging due to different provider APIs and security considerations.
2. **Data Modeling:** Designing an efficient MongoDB schema to store property listings, user profiles, and bookings while maintaining scalability.
3. **User Experience:** Creating an intuitive and responsive user interface for a seamless booking experience.
5. **Testing:** Comprehensive testing for both backend and frontend to identify and fix potential issues.
